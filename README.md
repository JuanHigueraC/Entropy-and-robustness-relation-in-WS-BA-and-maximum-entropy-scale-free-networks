Based on the biases found in the analytical analysis of the Preferential Attacthment algorithm, it is proposed to expand the robustness studies against cascading failures of geodesic communication for networks with representative topologies: small world and free of scale. This by means of an algorithm which we validate theoretically and computationally that allows to sample the assembly of networks with maximum entropy given a average distribution of degree as a ligature. In this robustness study we pay special emphasis on the possibility that the entropy of the distribution of some nodal parameter allows us to account for the differences in robustness.
