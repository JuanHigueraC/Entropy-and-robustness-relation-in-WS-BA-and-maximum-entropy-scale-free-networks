This project was presented for the course **Statistical Mechanics** of the National University of Colombia.

Based on the biases found in the analytical analysis of the Preferential Attacthment algorithm, it is proposed to expand the robustness studies against cascading failures of geodesic communication for networks with representative topologies: small world and free of scale. This by means of an algorithm which we validate theoretically and computationally that allows to sample the assembly of networks with maximum entropy given a average distribution of degree as a ligature. In this robustness study we pay special emphasis on the possibility that the entropy of the distribution of some nodal parameter allows us to account for the differences in robustness. 

## ¿Why is this important?

Scale-free distribution degree and small-world propertie are the most frecuently network properties found in nature, for this reason with Erdos-Renyi networks have been the most studyed type of networks. In the study of scale-free networks the barabasi-albert algorithm have been a standart, but ¿this algorithm generates networks that really are representative of the ensemble of scale-free networks? Some previous results (see **[1]**) suggest that this is not the case. In order to avoid this problem in a general way, its posible to use the Maximum Entropy Principle (MaxEnt), which allow us to generate ensembles of random networks that fullfill some restrictions, in particular the restriction of have a scale-free distribution. 

## Particular objetives of this work

**1.** Analytically develop, by means of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics tools, the process of evolution of networks known as preferential attachment, in order to find conditions for the networks generated by this model that limit its sample of the set of scale-free networks.

**2.** Analytically develop the canonical ensemble by imposing the average degree sequence as a constraint, from the partition function calculate the free energy and finally, using the free energy, calculate the components of the average adjacency matrix for this ensemble.

**3.** Establish in the Python language the algorithms that will be used for the study of robustness and entropy, that is, the algorithms to generate Watts-Strogatz, Barabási-Albert and Maximum Entropy networks; the cascade failure algorithms and those necessary to calculate the Shannon entropy for different nodal parameters of the network.

**4.** Sample the ensemble of scale-free networks using the previously programmed maximum entropy algorithm, from this sample calculate the average adjacency matrix and compare with the average adjacency matrix calculated from the canonical ensemble.

**5.** Carry out comparisons of robustness against cascade failures for networks generated by the Watts-Strogatz, Barabási-Albert and Maximum Entropy algorithms. Evaluating the possibility that the entropy with respect to some parameter of the network accounts for the differences in robustness.

## Results

**1.** Using some statistical mechanics tecniques and approximations, we obtain that the distribution of the degree in networks generated from the prefferential attacthment algorithm, has a exponent between 2 and 3. 

**2.** Using the Maximum Entropy Principle, the definition of Free Energy and derivatives of Free Energy, we calcule numerically the mean adjacency matrix of the ensemble of random networks with in average certain degree sequence extracted from a scale-free degree distribution.

**3.** Was established twelve functions, that contains all the code neccesary to reproduce this work. This functions are **pareto-cumm-probabilities**, **Degree-Sec-Generator**, **maxent-generator**, **graph-entropys**, **remove-hubs-load**, **edge-remove-hub-load**, **remove-aleatory**, **edge-remove-aleatory**, **hub-cascade-failure**, **edge-hub-cascade-failure**, **aleatory-cascade-failure** y **edge-aleatory-cascade-failure**. Its possible found all this functions in the folder Functions in this repository.
